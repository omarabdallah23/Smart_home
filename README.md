## Introduction:
Smart home technology is a technology concerned with automating homes. For example instead of turning lights manually, lights can be programmed to turn on by itself  when it gets dark or instead of 
setting the temperature at which your AC or heater operate manually, they can be programmed to turn on or off depending on room temperature.
This smart home project will consist of the following:
1. Front door lighting system.
2. AC control system.
3. Gate control system.
   
The schematic was designed on proteus 8 professional and the code was developed on MPLAB X IDE V6.15. The code was written in C and uploaded on PIC18f4620 microcontrollers
